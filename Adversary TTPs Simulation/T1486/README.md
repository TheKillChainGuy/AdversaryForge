# TEST 1: TTP Details

- Tactic = Encryption 
- TID = T1486 
- Technique Name = Data Encrypted for Impact 
- Procedure = Cipher for native Windows file encryption (EFS) 

## Simulation and Execution
This test simulates stealth ransomware-like behavior using native Windows tools in order to assess the detection and prevention capabilities of endpoint protection systems against living-off-the-land encryption tactics. This test specifically avoids third-party or overt ransomware binaries, making it harder to detect.

Deploy and execute the `Cipher.bat` batch script on the test machine.


# TEST 2: TTP Details

- Tactic = Encryption 
- TID = T1486 
- Technique Name = Data Encrypted for Impact 
- Procedure = Certutil for Encryption 

## Simulation and Execution

This test simulates a file encryption scenario using a native Windows utility (certutil.exe) for Base64 encoding. The objective is to assess the security solutionâ€™s ability to detect misuse of certutil for stealthy data transformation and simulate behavior similar to ransomware groups using non-executable methods.

Deploy and execute the `Certutil.ps1` batch script on the test machine.
