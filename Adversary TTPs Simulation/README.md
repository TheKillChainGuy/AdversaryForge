# About
This repository is the Simulation of Threat actor tactics that Red Teamers and detection engineers can leverage to replicate real-world adversary tactics to evaluate the security posture, identify the gaps, and test detection rules. 

These Simulations follow a red team model that replicates authentic adversary tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), guided by well-defined attack scenarios and objectives. This approach assesses the full scope of an organization’s defenses—including people, processes, and technology.

This methodology is fully aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework and emulates the tactics used by Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)/Ransomware groups.
