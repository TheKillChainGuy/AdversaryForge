# AdversaryForge
AdversaryForge is a curated collection of adversary simulation tests designed to emulate real-world attacker behaviors across the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework. Inspired by Atomic Red Team, this project provides modular, easy-to-execute scripts and test cases that help defenders validate detections, fine-tune telemetry, and strengthen security controls.

## Features
🔬 TTP-Level Simulations – Focused on individual MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

⚙️ Modular & Reusable – Each test is self-contained and easy to integrate into CI/CD pipelines or detection engineering workflows.

💥 Cross-Platform – Tests for Windows, Linux, and macOS environments.

🧠 CTI-Informed – Aligned with current threat intelligence and real-world actor behaviors.

🧪 Detection Engineering Ready – Built for SOC teams, purple teams, and detection engineers.
