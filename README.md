# AdversaryForge
AdversaryForge is a curated collection of adversary simulation tests designed to emulate real-world attacker behaviors across the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework. Inspired by Atomic Red Team, this project provides modular, easy-to-execute scripts and test cases that help defenders validate detections, fine-tune telemetry, and strengthen security controls.
